Week 4 Quiz

Question 1
What is produced at the end of this snippet of R code?
set.seed(1)
rpois(5, 2)
Ans: A vector with the numbers 1, 1, 2, 4, 1


Question 2
What R function can be used to generate standard Normal random variables?
Ans: rnorm

Question 3
When simulating data, why is using the set.seed() function important? Select all that apply.
Ans: It ensures that the sequence of random numbers starts in a specific place and is therefore reproducible.

Question 4
Which function can be used to evaluate the inverse cumulative distribution function for the Poisson distribution?
Ans: qpois

Question 5
What does the following code do?
set.seed(10)
x <- rep(0:1, each = 5)
e <- rnorm(10, 0, 20)
y <- 0.5 + 2 * x + e
Ans: Generate data from a Normal linear model


Question 6
What R function can be used to generate Binomial random variables?
Ans: rbinom

Question 7
What aspect of the R runtime does the profiler keep track of when an R expression is evaluated?
Ans: the function call stack

Question 8
Consider the following R code
library(datasets)
Rprof()
fit <- lm(y ~ x1 + x2)
Rprof(NULL)
Ans: 100%

Question 9
When using 'system.time()', what is the user time?
Ans: It is the time spent by the CPU evaluating an expression

Question 10
If a computer has more than one available processor and R is able to take advantage of that, then which of the following is true when using 'system.time()'?

Ans: elapsed time may be smaller than user time
