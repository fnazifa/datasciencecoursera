Week 2 Quiz 1

1) Suppose I define the following function in R
    cube <- function(x, n) {
        x^3
    }    
    Result of runnning:
    ~ cube(3)
    in R after defining this function?

    #The users is prompted to specify the value of 'n'.
    #An error is returned because 'n' is not specified in the call to 'cube'
    #The number 27 is returned <RIGHT>
    #A warning is given with no value returned.
    
2) The following code will produce a warning in R.
    x <- 1:10
    if(x > 5) {
            x <- 0
    }
    
    #The syntax of this R expression is incorrect.
    #You cannot set 'x' to be 0 because 'x' is a vector and 0 is a scalar.
    #'x' is a vector of length 10 and 'if' can only test a single logical statement. <RIGHT>
    #The expression uses curly braces.
    #There are no elements in 'x' that are greater than 5

3) Consider the following function
    f <- function(x) {
            g <- function(y) {
                    y + z
            }
            z <- 4
            x + g(x)
    }
    If I then run in R
    ~ z <- 10
      f(3)
      
      What value is returned?

        # 7
        # 16
        # 10 <Correct>
        # 4
        
4) Consider the following expression:
    x <- 5
    y <- if(x < 3) {
            NA
    } else {
            10
    }
    
    What is the value of 'y' after evaluating this expression?

    # NA
    # 10 <Correct>
    # 5
    # 3
    
5) Consider the following R function:
    h <- function(x, y = NULL, d = 3L) {
        z <- cbind(x, d)
        if(!is.null(y))
                z <- z + y
        else
                z <- z + f
        g <- x + y / z
        if(d == 3L)
                return(g)
        g <- g + 10
        g
    }
    
    # f <Correct>
    # z
    # d
    # L
    # g
    
6) What is an environment in R?

    # a collection of symbol/value pairs <Correct>
    # an R package that only contains data
    # a special type of function
    # a list whose elements are all functions
    
7) The R language uses what type of scoping rule for resolving free variables?

    # lexical scoping <Correct>
    # compilation scoping
    # dynamic scoping
    # global scoping
    
8) How are free variables in R functions resolved?

    # The values of free variables are searched for in the environment in which the function was defined <Correct>
    # The values of free variables are searched for in the environment in which the function was called
    # The values of free variables are searched for in the global environment
    # The values of free variables are searched for in the working directory

9) What is one of the consequences of the scoping rules used in R?

    # All objects must be stored in memory <Correct> 
    # Functions cannot be nested
    # R objects cannot be larger than 100 MB
    # All objects can be stored on the disk
    
10) In R, what is the parent frame?

    It is always the global environment
    It is the environment in which a function was called <Correct> 
    It is the package search list
    It is the environment in which a function was defined
