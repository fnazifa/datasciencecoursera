| In this lesson, we'll cover matrices and data frames. Both represent 'rectangular' data
| types, meaning that they are used to store tabular data, with rows and columns.

...

  |==                                                                                |   3%
| The main difference, as you'll see, is that matrices can only contain a single class of
| data, while data frames can consist of many different classes of data.

...

  |=====                                                                             |   6%
| Let's create a vector containing the numbers 1 through 20 using the `:` operator. Store
| the result in a variable called my_vector.

> 
> my_vector <- c(1:20)

| Give it another try. Or, type info() for more options.

| You learned about the `:` operator in the lesson on sequences. If you wanted to create a
| vector containing the numbers 1, 2, and 3 (in that order), you could use either c(1, 2,
| 3) or 1:3. In this case, we want the numbers 1 through 20 stored in a variable called
| my_vector. Also, remember that you don't need the c() function when using `:`.

> my_vector <- c(1:20)

| Keep trying! Or, type info() for more options.

| You are doing so well!

  |=======                                                                           |   8%
| View the contents of the vector you just created.

| Keep up the great work!

  |=========                                                                         |  11%
| The dim() function tells us the 'dimensions' of an object. What happens if we do
| dim(my_vector)? Give it a try.

> dim(my_vector)
NULL

| You are quite good my friend!

  |===========                                                                       |  14%
| Clearly, that's not very helpful! Since my_vector is a vector, it doesn't have a `dim`
| attribute (so it's just NULL), but we can find its length using the length() function.
| Try that now.

> length(my_vector)
[1] 20

| Excellent work!

  |==============                                                                    |  17%
| Ah! That's what we wanted. But, what happens if we give my_vector a `dim` attribute?
| Let's give it a try. Type dim(my_vector) <- c(4, 5).

> dim(my_vector) <- c(4,5)

| You nailed it! Good job!

  |================                                                                  |  19%
| It's okay if that last command seemed a little strange to you. It should! The dim()
| function allows you to get OR set the `dim` attribute for an R object. In this case, we
| assigned the value c(4, 5) to the `dim` attribute of my_vector.

...

  |==================                                                                |  22%
| Use dim(my_vector) to confirm that we've set the `dim` attribute correctly.

> dim(my_vector)
[1] 4 5

| You are really on a roll!

  |====================                                                              |  25%
| Another way to see this is by calling the attributes() function on my_vector. Try it now.

> play()

| Entering play mode. Experiment as you please, then type nxt() when you are ready to
| resume the lesson.

> dim(my_vector)
[1] 4 5
> nxt()

| Resuming lesson...


| Another way to see this is by calling the attributes() function on my_vector. Try it now.

> attributes(my_vector)
$`dim`
[1] 4 5


| You are amazing!

  |=======================                                                           |  28%
| Just like in math class, when dealing with a 2-dimensional object (think rectangular
| table), the first number is the number of rows and the second is the number of columns.
| Therefore, we just gave my_vector 4 rows and 5 columns.

...

  |=========================                                                         |  31%
| But, wait! That doesn't sound like a vector any more. Well, it's not. Now it's a matrix.
| View the contents of my_vector now to see what it looks like.

| Now, let's confirm it's actually a matrix by using the class() function. Type
| class(my_vector) to see what I mean.

> class(my_vector)
[1] "matrix"

| Your dedication is inspiring!

  |==============================                                                    |  36%
| Sure enough, my_vector is now a matrix. We should store it in a new variable that helps
| us remember what it is. Store the value of my_vector in a new variable called my_matrix.

> my_matrix <- my_vector

| You got it!

  |================================                                                  |  39%
| The example that we've used so far was meant to illustrate the point that a matrix is
| simply an atomic vector with a dimension attribute. A more direct method of creating the
| same matrix uses the matrix() function.

...

  |==================================                                                |  42%
| Bring up the help file for the matrix() function now using the `?` function.

> 
> ?matrix

| You are quite good my friend!

  |====================================                                              |  44%
| Now, look at the documentation for the matrix function and see if you can figure out how
| to create a matrix containing the same numbers (1-20) and dimensions (4 rows, 5 columns)
| by calling the matrix() function. Store the result in a variable called my_matrix2.

> my_matrix(1:20, nrow=4, ncol=5)
Error in my_matrix(1:20, nrow = 4, ncol = 5) : 
  could not find function "my_matrix"
> my_matrix(1:20, nrow=4, ncol=5, byrow = TRUE)
Error in my_matrix(1:20, nrow = 4, ncol = 5, byrow = TRUE) : 
  could not find function "my_matrix"
> my_matrix(c(1:20), nrow=4, ncol=5, byrow = TRUE)
Error in my_matrix(c(1:20), nrow = 4, ncol = 5, byrow = TRUE) : 
  could not find function "my_matrix"
> my_matrix <- matrix(1:20), nrow=4, ncol=5, byrow = TRUE)
Error: unexpected ',' in "my_matrix <- matrix(1:20),"
> my_matrix <- matrix(1:20, nrow=4, ncol=5, byrow = TRUE)

| Not quite, but you're learning! Try again. Or, type info() for more options.

| Call the matrix() function with three arguments -- 1:20, the number of rows, and the
| number of columns. Be sure to specify arguments by their proper names and store the
| result in my_matrix2 (not in my_matrix).

> my_matrix <- matrix(1:20, nrow=4, ncol=5)

| You're close...I can feel it! Try it again. Or, type info() for more options.

| Call the matrix() function with three arguments -- 1:20, the number of rows, and the

> my_matrix2 <- matrix(1:20, 4, 5)

| You nailed it! Good job!

  |=======================================                                           |  47%
| Finally, let's confirm that my_matrix and my_matrix2 are actually identical. The
| identical() function will tell us if its first two arguments are the same. Try it out.

> identical(my_matrix, my_matrix2)
[1] TRUE

| Keep up the great work!

  |=========================================                                         |  50%
| Now, imagine that the numbers in our table represent some measurements from a clinical
| experiment, where each row represents one patient and each column represents one variable
| for which measurements were taken.

...

  |===========================================                                       |  53%
| We may want to label the rows, so that we know which numbers belong to each patient in
| the experiment. One way to do this is to add a column to the matrix, which contains the
| names of all four people.

...

  |==============================================                                    |  56%
| Let's start by creating a character vector containing the names of our patients -- Bill,
| Gina, Kelly, and Sean. Remember that double quotes tell R that something is a character
| string. Store the result in a variable called patients.

> patients <- c("Bill","Gina", "Kelly", "Sean")

| That's correct!

  |================================================                                  |  58%
| Now we'll use the cbind() function to 'combine columns'. Don't worry about storing the
| result in a new variable. Just call cbind() with two arguments -- the patients vector and
| my_matrix.

> cbind(my_matrix, patients)
                            patients
[1,] "1" "5" "9"  "13" "17" "Bill"  
[2,] "2" "6" "10" "14" "18" "Gina"  
[3,] "3" "7" "11" "15" "19" "Kelly" 
[4,] "4" "8" "12" "16" "20" "Sean"  

| Almost! Try again. Or, type info() for more options.

| Type cbind(patients, my_matrix) to add the names of our patients to the matrix of
| numbers.

> cbind(patients, my_matrix)
     patients                       
[1,] "Bill"   "1" "5" "9"  "13" "17"
[2,] "Gina"   "2" "6" "10" "14" "18"
[3,] "Kelly"  "3" "7" "11" "15" "19"
[4,] "Sean"   "4" "8" "12" "16" "20"

| You are quite good my friend!

  |==================================================                                |  61%
| Something is fishy about our result! It appears that combining the character vector with
| our matrix of numbers caused everything to be enclosed in double quotes. This means we're
| left with a matrix of character strings, which is no good.

...

  |====================================================                              |  64%
| If you remember back to the beginning of this lesson, I told you that matrices can only
| contain ONE class of data. Therefore, when we tried to combine a character vector with a
| numeric matrix, R was forced to 'coerce' the numbers to characters, hence the double
| quotes.

...

  |=======================================================                           |  67%
| This is called 'implicit coercion', because we didn't ask for it. It just happened. But
| why didn't R just convert the names of our patients to numbers? I'll let you ponder that
| question on your own.

...

  |=========================================================                         |  69%
| So, we're still left with the question of how to include the names of our patients in the
| table without destroying the integrity of our numeric data. Try the following -- my_data
| <- data.frame(patients, my_matrix)

> my_data <- data.frame(patients, my_matrix)

| That's the answer I was looking for.

  |===========================================================                       |  72%
| Now view the contents of my_data to see what we've come up with.

> my_data
  patients X1 X2 X3 X4 X5
1     Bill  1  5  9 13 17
2     Gina  2  6 10 14 18
3    Kelly  3  7 11 15 19
4     Sean  4  8 12 16 20

| Your dedication is inspiring!

  |==============================================================                    |  75%
| It looks like the data.frame() function allowed us to store our character vector of names
| right alongside our matrix of numbers. That's exactly what we were hoping for!

...

  |================================================================                  |  78%
| Behind the scenes, the data.frame() function takes any number of arguments and returns a
| single object of class `data.frame` that is composed of the original objects.

...

  |==================================================================                |  81%
| Let's confirm this by calling the class() function on our newly created data frame.

> class(my_data)
[1] "data.frame"

| Excellent job!

  |====================================================================              |  83%
| It's also possible to assign names to the individual rows and columns of a data frame,
| which presents another possible way of determining which row of values in our table
| belongs to each patient.

...

  |=======================================================================           |  86%
| However, since we've already solved that problem, let's solve a different problem by
| assigning names to the columns of our data frame so that we know what type of measurement
| each column represents.

...

  |=========================================================================         |  89%
| Since we have six columns (including patient names), we'll need to first create a vector
| containing one element for each column. Create a character vector called cnames that
| contains the following values (in order) -- "patient", "age", "weight", "bp", "rating",
| "test".

> cbind(c("patient", "age", "weight", "bp", "rating", "test"), c(1:6))
     [,1]      [,2]
[1,] "patient" "1" 
[2,] "age"     "2" 
[3,] "weight"  "3" 
[4,] "bp"      "4" 
[5,] "rating"  "5" 
[6,] "test"    "6" 

| That's not exactly what I'm looking for. Try again. Or, type info() for more options.

| Make sure all of the names are lowercase, surrounded by double quotes, and separated with
| commas. Don't forget to use the c() function.

> cbind(c(1:6), c("patient", "age", "weight", "bp", "rating", "test"))
     [,1] [,2]     
[1,] "1"  "patient"
[2,] "2"  "age"    
[3,] "3"  "weight" 
[4,] "4"  "bp"     
[5,] "5"  "rating" 
[6,] "6"  "test"   

| Not quite, but you're learning! Try again. Or, type info() for more options.

| Make sure all of the names are lowercase, surrounded by double quotes, and separated with
| commas. Don't forget to use the c() function.

> cnames <- c("patient", "age", "weight", "bp", "rating", "test")

| Perseverance, that's the answer.

  |===========================================================================       |  92%
| Now, use the colnames() function to set the `colnames` attribute for our data frame. This
| is similar to the way we used the dim() function earlier in this lesson.

> colnames(cnames)
NULL

| That's not exactly what I'm looking for. Try again. Or, type info() for more options.

| Try colnames(my_data) <- cnames.

> colnames(my_data) <- cnames

| That's a job well done!

  |=============================================================================     |  94%
| Let's see if that got the job done. Print the contents of my_data.

> my_data
  patient age weight bp rating test

4    Sean   4      8 12     16   20

| Perseverance, that's the answer.

  |================================================================================  |  97%
| In this lesson, you learned the basics of working with two very important and common data
| structures -- matrices and data frames. There's much more to learn and we'll be covering
| more advanced topics, particularly with respect to data frames, in future lessons.
