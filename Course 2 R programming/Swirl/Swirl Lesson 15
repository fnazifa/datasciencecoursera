| One of the greatest strengths of R, relative to other programming languages, is the
| ease with which we can create publication-quality graphics. In this lesson, you'll
| learn about base graphics in R.

| There is a school of thought that this approach is backwards, that we should teach
| ggplot2 first. See http://varianceexplained.org/r/teach_ggplot2_to_beginners/ for an

| To fix ideas, we will work with simple data frames. Our main goal is to introduce

| Pull up the help page for cars.

| That's correct!

  |==========                                                                   |  13%
| As you can see in the help page, the cars data set has only two variables: speed and
| stopping distance. Note that the data is from the 1920s.

...

  |============                                                                 |  15%

| Before plotting, it is always a good idea to get a sense of the data. Key R commands
| for doing so include, dim(), names(), head(), tail() and summary().

...

  |===============                                                              |  20%
| Run the plot() command on the cars data frame.

> plot(cars)

| You are amazing!

  |=================                                                            |  22%
| As always, R tries very hard to give you something sensible given the information
| that you have provided to it. First, R notes that the data frame you have given it
| has just two columns, so it assumes that you want to plot one column versus the
| other.

...

  |==================                                                           |  24%
| Second, since we do not provide labels for either axis, R uses the names of the
| columns. Third, it creates axis tick marks at nice round numbers and labels them
| accordingly. Fourth, it uses the other defaults supplied in plot().

...

  |====================                                                         |  26%
| We will now spend some time exploring plot, but many of the topics covered here will
| apply to most other R graphics functions. Note that 'plot' is short for scatterplot.

...

  |======================                                                       |  28%
| Look up the help page for plot().

> ?plot

| You are amazing!

  |=======================                                                      |  30%
| The help page for plot() highlights the different arguments that the function can
| take. The two most important are x and y, the variables that will be plotted. For
| the next set of questions, include the argument names in your answers. That is, do
| not type plot(cars$speed, cars$dist), although that will work. Instead, use plot(x =
| cars$speed, y = cars$dist).

...

  |=========================                                                    |  33%
| Use plot() command to show speed on the x-axis and dist on the y-axis from the cars
| data frame. Use the form of the plot command in which vectors are explicitly passed
| in as arguments for x and y.

> plot(x=cars$speed, y=cars$dist)

| You're the best!

  |===========================                                                  |  35%
| Note that this produces a slightly different answer than plot(cars). In this case, R
| is not sure what you want to use as the labels on the axes, so it just uses the
| arguments which you pass in, data frame name and dollar signs included.

...

  |============================                                                 |  37%
| Note that there are other ways to call the plot command, i.e., using the "formula"
| interface. For example, we get a similar plot to the above with plot(dist ~ speed,
| cars). However, we will wait till later in the lesson before using the formula
| interface.

...

  |==============================                                               |  39%
| Use plot() command to show dist on the x-axis and speed on the y-axis from the cars
| data frame. This is the opposite of what we did above.

> plot()
Error in xy.coords(x, y, xlabel, ylabel, log) : 
  argument "x" is missing, with no default
> plot(dist ~ speed, cars)

| One more time. You can do it! Or, type info() for more options.

| Type plot(x = cars$dist, y = cars$speed) to create the plot.

> plot(x=cars$speed, y=cars$dist)

| You're close...I can feel it! Try it again. Or, type info() for more options.

| Type plot(x = cars$dist, y = cars$speed) to create the plot.

> plot(x=cars$dist, y=cars$speed)

| Your dedication is inspiring!

  |================================                                             |  41%
| It probably makes more sense for speed to go on the x-axis since stopping distance
| is a function of speed more than the other way around. So, for the rest of the
| questions in this portion of the lesson, always assign the arguments accordingly.

...

  |=================================                                            |  43%
| In fact, you can assume that the answers to the next few questions are all of the
| form plot(x = cars$speed, y = cars$dist, ...) but with various arguments used in
| place of the ...

| Recreate the plot with the label of the x-axis set to "Speed".

> plot(x=Speed, y=cars$speed)
Error in plot(x = Speed, y = cars$speed) : object 'Speed' not found
> plot(Speed, y=cars$speed)
Error in plot(Speed, y = cars$speed) : object 'Speed' not found
> plot(x=cars$speed, y=cars$speed)

| That's not the answer I was looking for, but try again. Or, type info() for more
| options.

| Type plot(x = cars$speed, y = cars$dist, xlab = "Speed") to create the plot.

> plot(x=cars$speed, y=cars$dist, xlab = "Speed")

| Perseverance, that's the answer.

  |=====================================                                        |  48%
| Recreate the plot with the label of the y-axis set to "Stopping Distance".

> plot(x=cars$speed, y=cars$dist, xlab = "Speed", ylab = "Stopping Distance")

| Keep trying! Or, type info() for more options.

| Type plot(x = cars$speed, y = cars$dist, ylab = "Stopping Distance") to create the
| plot.

> plot(x=cars$speed, y=cars$dist, ylab = "Stopping Distance")

| You're the best!

  |======================================                                       |  50%
| Recreate the plot with "Speed" and "Stopping Distance" as axis labels.

> plot(x=cars$speed, y=cars$dist, xlab = "Speed", ylab = "Stopping Distance")

| Nice work!

  |========================================                                     |  52%
| The reason that plots(cars) worked at the beginning of the lesson was that R was
| smart enough to know that the first element (i.e., the first column) in cars should
| be assigned to the x argument and the second element to the y argument. To save on
| typing, the next set of answers will all be of the form, plot(cars, ...) with
| various arguments added.

...

  |==========================================                                   |  54%
| For each question, we will only want one additional argument at a time. Of course,
| you can pass in more than one argument when doing a real project.

...

  |============================================                                 |  57%
| Plot cars with a main title of "My Plot". Note that the argument for the main title
| is "main" not "title".

> plot(x=cars$speed, y=cars$dist, main = "My Plot"
+ .
Error: unexpected symbol in:
"plot(x=cars$speed, y=cars$dist, main = "My Plot"
."
> plot(x=cars$speed, y=cars$dist, main = "My Plot")

| Try again. Getting it right on the first try is boring anyway! Or, type info() for
| more options.

| Type plot(cars, main = "My Plot") to create the plot.

> plot(cars, main = "My Plot")

| You are quite good my friend!

  |=============================================                                |  59%
| Plot cars with a sub title of "My Plot Subtitle".

> plot(cars, main = "My Plot")

| You're close...I can feel it! Try it again. Or, type info() for more options.

| Type plot(cars, sub = "My Plot Subtitle") to create the plot.

> plot(cars, sub = "My Plot Subtitle")

| You nailed it! Good job!

  |===============================================                              |  61%
| The plot help page (?plot) only covers a small number of the many arguments that can
| be passed in to plot() and to other graphical functions. To begin to explore the
| many other options, look at ?par. Let's look at some of the more commonly used ones.
| Continue using plot(cars, ...) as the base answer to these questions.

|=================================================                            |  63%
| Plot cars so that the plotted points are colored red. (Use col = 2 to achieve this
| effect.)

> plot(cars, col = 2)

| You are amazing!

  |==================================================                           |  65%
| Plot cars while limiting the x-axis to 10 through 15.  (Use xlim = c(10, 15) to
| achieve this effect.)

> plot(cars, xlim = c(10,15))

| You are doing so well!

  |====================================================                         |  67%
| You can also change the shape of the symbols in the plot. The help page for points
| (?points) provides the details.

...

  |======================================================                       |  70%
| Plot cars using triangles.  (Use pch = 2 to achieve this effect.)

> plot(cars, pch=2)

| You got it right!

  |=======================================================                      |  72%
| Arguments like "col" and "pch" may not seem very intuitive. And that is because they
| aren't! So, many/most people use more modern packages, like ggplot2, for creating
| their graphics in R.

...

  |=========================================================                    |  74%
| It is, however, useful to have an introduction to base graphics because many of the
| idioms in lattice and ggplot2 are modeled on them.

...

  |===========================================================                  |  76%
| Let's now look at some other functions in base graphics that may be useful, starting
| with boxplots.

...

  |============================================================                 |  78%
| Load the mtcars data frame.

> load(mtcars)
Error in load(mtcars) : bad 'file' argument
> data("mtcars")

| One more time. You can do it! Or, type info() for more options.

| Type data(mtcars) to load the data.

> data(mtcars)

| Excellent job!

  |==============================================================               |  80%
| Anytime that you load up a new data frame, you should explore it before using it. In
| the middle of a swirl lesson, just type play(). This temporarily suspends the lesson
| (without losing the work you have already done) and allows you to issue commands
| like dim(mtcars) and head(mtcars). Once you are done examining the data, just type
| nxt() and the lesson will pick up where it left off.

...

  |================================================================             |  83%
| Look up the help page for boxplot().

> ?boxplot

| You nailed it! Good job!

  |=================================================================            |  85%
| Instead of adding data columns directly as input arguments, as we did with plot(),
| it is often handy to pass in the entire data frame. This is what the "data" argument
| in boxplot() allows.

...

  |===================================================================          |  87%
| boxplot(), like many R functions, also takes a "formula" argument, generally an
| expression with a tilde ("~") which indicates the relationship between the input
| variables. This allows you to enter something like mpg ~ cyl to plot the
| relationship between cyl (number of cylinders) on the x-axis and mpg (miles per
| gallon) on the y-axis.

...

  |=====================================================================        |  89%
| Use boxplot() with formula = mpg ~ cyl and data = mtcars to create a box plot.

> boxplot(formula( mpg ~ cyl))
Error in eval(predvars, data, env) : object 'mpg' not found
> boxplot(mtcars, formula( mpg ~ cyl))

| Not exactly. Give it another go. Or, type info() for more options.

| Type boxplot(formula = mpg ~ cyl, data = mtcars) to create the plot.

> boxplot(formula( mpg ~ cyl), data = mtcars)

| That's not exactly what I'm looking for. Try again. Or, type info() for more
| options.

| Type boxplot(formula = mpg ~ cyl, data = mtcars) to create the plot.

> boxplot(formula = mpg ~ cyl, data = mtcars)

| All that hard work is paying off!

  |======================================================================       |  91%
| The plot shows that mpg is much lower for cars with more cylinders. Note that we can
| use the same set of arguments that we explored with plot() above to add axis labels,
| titles and so on.

...

  |========================================================================     |  93%
| When looking at a single variable, histograms are a useful tool. hist() is the
| associated R function. Like plot(), hist() is best used by just passing in a single
| vector.

...

  |==========================================================================   |  96%
| Use hist() with the vector mtcars$mpg to create a histogram.

> hist(mtcars$mpg)

| All that hard work is paying off!

  |===========================================================================  |  98%
| In this lesson, you learned how to work with base graphics in R. The best place to
| go from here is to study the ggplot2 package. If you want to explore other elements
| of base graphics, then this web page
