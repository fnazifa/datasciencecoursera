In this lesson, we will explore some basic building blocks of the R programming
| language.

...

  |==                                                                    |   3%
| If at any point you'd like more information on a particular topic related to R,
| you can type help.start() at the prompt, which will open a menu of resources
| (either within RStudio or your default web browser, depending on your setup).
| Alternatively, a simple web search often yields the answer you're looking for.

...

  |====                                                                  |   5%
| In its simplest form, R can be used as an interactive calculator. Type 5 + 7 and
| press Enter.

> 12
[1] 12

| Almost! Try again. Or, type info() for more options.

| Type 5 + 7 and press Enter.

> 5 + 7
[1] 12

| You are doing so well!

  |======                                                                |   8%
| R simply prints the result of 12 by default. However, R is a programming language
| and often the reason we use a programming language as opposed to a calculator is
| to automate some process or avoid unnecessary repetition.

...

  |=======                                                               |  11%
| In this case, we may want to use our result from above in a second calculation.
| Instead of retyping 5 + 7 every time we need it, we can just create a new variable
| that stores the result.

...

  |=========                                                             |  13%
| The way you assign a value to a variable in R is by using the assignment operator,
| which is just a 'less than' symbol followed by a 'minus' sign. It looks like this:
| <-

...

  |===========                                                           |  16%
| Think of the assignment operator as an arrow. You are assigning the value on the
| right side of the arrow to the variable name on the left side of the arrow.

...

  |=============                                                         |  18%
| To assign the result of 5 + 7 to a new variable called x, you type x <- 5 + 7.
| This can be read as 'x gets 5 plus 7'. Give it a try now.

> x <- % + 7
Error: unexpected input in "x <- % + 7"
> x <- 5 + 7

| That's a job well done!

  |===============                                                       |  21%
| You'll notice that R did not print the result of 12 this time. When you use the
| assignment operator, R assumes that you don't want to see the result immediately,
| but rather that you intend to use the result for something else later on.

...

  |=================                                                     |  24%
| To view the contents of the variable x, just type x and press Enter. Try it now.

> x
[1] 12

| Your dedication is inspiring!

  |==================                                                    |  26%
| Now, store the result of x - 3 in a new variable called y.

> y <- x-3

| Excellent job!

  |====================                                                  |  29%
| What is the value of y? Type y to find out.

> y
[1] 9

| All that practice is paying off!

  |======================                                                |  32%
| Now, let's create a small collection of numbers called a vector. Any object that
| contains data is called a data structure and numeric vectors are the simplest type
| of data structure in R. In fact, even a single number is considered a vector of
| length one.

...

  |========================                                              |  34%
| The easiest way to create a vector is with the c() function, which stands for
| 'concatenate' or 'combine'. To create a vector containing the numbers 1.1, 9, and
| 3.14, type c(1.1, 9, 3.14). Try it now and store the result in a variable called
| z.

> z <- c(1.1, 9, 3.14)

| Perseverance, that's the answer.

  |==========================                                            |  37%
| Anytime you have questions about a particular function, you can access R's
| built-in help files via the `?` command. For example, if you want more information
| on the c() function, type ?c without the parentheses that normally follow a
| function name. Give it a try.

> ?c

| Perseverance, that's the answer.

  |============================                                          |  39%
| Type z to view its contents. Notice that there are no commas separating the values
| in the output.

> z
[1] 1.10 9.00 3.14

| You got it!

  |=============================                                         |  42%
| You can combine vectors to make a new vector. Create a new vector that contains z,
| 555, then z again in that order. Don't assign this vector to a new variable, so
| that we can just see the result immediately.

> C(z, 555, z)
Error in C(z, 555, z) : object not interpretable as a factor
> c(1.1, 9, 3.14), 555, c(1.1, 9, 3.14)
Error: unexpected ',' in "c(1.1, 9, 3.14),"
> c(c(1.1, 9, 3.14), 555, c(1.1, 9, 3.14))
[1]   1.10   9.00   3.14 555.00   1.10   9.00   3.14

| That's not exactly what I'm looking for. Try again. Or, type info() for more
| options.

| Type c(z, 555, z). Don't create a new variable. We just want to view the result.

> info()

| When you are at the R prompt (>):
| -- Typing skip() allows you to skip the current question.
| -- Typing play() lets you experiment with R on your own; swirl will ignore what
| you do...
| -- UNTIL you type nxt() which will regain swirl's attention.
| -- Typing bye() causes swirl to exit. Your progress will be saved.
| -- Typing main() returns you to swirl's main menu.
| -- Typing info() displays these options again.

> a = C(z, 555, z)
Error in C(z, 555, z) : object not interpretable as a factor
> list(z, 555, z)
[[1]]
[1] 1.10 9.00 3.14

[[2]]
[1] 555

[[3]]
[1] 1.10 9.00 3.14


| You're close...I can feel it! Try it again. Or, type info() for more options.

| Type c(z, 555, z). Don't create a new variable. We just want to view the result.

> c(z, 555, z)
[1]   1.10   9.00   3.14 555.00   1.10   9.00   3.14

| Perseverance, that's the answer.

  |===============================                                       |  45%
| Numeric vectors can be used in arithmetic expressions. Type the following to see
| what happens: z * 2 + 100.

> z * 2 + 100
[1] 102.20 118.00 106.28

| You are amazing!

  |=================================                                     |  47%
| First, R multiplied each of the three elements in z by 2. Then it added 100 to
| each element to get the result you see above.

...

  |===================================                                   |  50%
| Other common arithmetic operators are `+`, `-`, `/`, and `^` (where x^2 means 'x
| squared'). To take the square root, use the sqrt() function and to take the
| absolute value, use the abs() function.

...

  |=====================================                                 |  53%
| Take the square root of z - 1 and assign it to a new variable called my_sqrt.

> sqrt(z)
[1] 1.048809 3.000000 1.772005

| That's not the answer I was looking for, but try again. Or, type info() for more
| options.

| Assign the result of sqrt(z - 1) to a variable called my_sqrt.

> my_sqrt <- sqrt(z)

| You're close...I can feel it! Try it again. Or, type info() for more options.

| Assign the result of sqrt(z - 1) to a variable called my_sqrt.

> my_sqrt <- sqrt(z-1)

| Keep working like that and you'll get there!

  |=======================================                               |  55%
| Before we view the contents of the my_sqrt variable, what do you think it
| contains?

1: a vector of length 3
2: a single number (i.e a vector of length 1)
3: a vector of length 0 (i.e. an empty vector)

Selection: 1

| That's the answer I was looking for.

  |=========================================                             |  58%
| Print the contents of my_sqrt.

> my_sqrt
[1] 0.3162278 2.8284271 1.4628739

| Keep up the great work!

  |==========================================                            |  61%
| As you may have guessed, R first subtracted 1 from each element of z, then took
| the square root of each element. This leaves you with a vector of the same length
| as the original vector z.

...

  |============================================                          |  63%
| Now, create a new variable called my_div that gets the value of z divided by
| my_sqrt.

> my_div <- z/my_sqrt

| You are quite good my friend!

  |==============================================                        |  66%
| Which statement do you think is true?

1: my_div is a single number (i.e a vector of length 1)
2: my_div is undefined
3: The first element of my_div is equal to the first element of z divided by the first element of my_sqrt, and so on...

Selection: 3

| You are quite good my friend!

  |================================================                      |  68%
| Go ahead and print the contents of my_div.

> my_div

| Your dedication is inspiring!

  |==================================================                    |  71%
| When given two vectors of the same length, R simply performs the specified
| arithmetic operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, etc.) element-by-element. If the vectors are
| of different lengths, R 'recycles' the shorter vector until it is the same length
| as the longer vector.

...

  |====================================================                  |  74%
| When we did z * 2 + 100 in our earlier example, z was a vector of length 3, but
| technically 2 and 100 are each vectors of length 1.

...

  |=====================================================                 |  76%
| Behind the scenes, R is 'recycling' the 2 to make a vector of 2s and the 100 to
| make a vector of 100s. In other words, when you ask R to compute z * 2 + 100, what
| it really computes is this: z * c(2, 2, 2) + c(100, 100, 100).

...

  |=======================================================               |  79%
| To see another example of how this vector 'recycling' works, try adding c(1, 2, 3,
| 4) and c(0, 10). Don't worry about saving the result in a new variable.

> b = c(1, 2, 3, 4)

| Not quite right, but keep trying. Or, type info() for more options.

| Enter c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10) in the console to see how R adds two vectors of
| different length. Don't assign the result to a variable.

> c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10)
[1]  1 12  3 14

| That's a job well done!

  |=========================================================             |  82%
| If the length of the shorter vector does not divide evenly into the length of the
| longer vector, R will still apply the 'recycling' method, but will throw a warning
| to let you know something fishy might be going on.

...

  |===========================================================           |  84%
| Try c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10, 100) for an example.

> c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10, 100)
[1]   1  12 103   4
Warning message:
In c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10, 100) :
  longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length

| That's the answer I was looking for.

  |=============================================================         |  87%
| Before concluding this lesson, I'd like to show you a couple of time-saving
| tricks.

...

  |===============================================================       |  89%
| Earlier in the lesson, you computed z * 2 + 100. Let's pretend that you made a
| mistake and that you meant to add 1000 instead of 100. You could either re-type
| the expression, or...

...

  |================================================================      |  92%
| In many programming environments, the up arrow will cycle through previous
| commands. Try hitting the up arrow on your keyboard until you get to this command
| (z * 2 + 100), then change 100 to 1000 and hit Enter. If the up arrow doesn't work
| for you, just type the corrected command.

> 
> z * 2 + 1000
[1] 1002.20 1018.00 1006.28

| You are quite good my friend!

  |==================================================================    |  95%
| Finally, let's pretend you'd like to view the contents of a variable that you
| created earlier, but you can't seem to remember if you named it my_div or myDiv.
| You could try both and see what works, or...

...my_div

  |====================================================================  |  97%
| You can type the first two letters of the variable name, then hit the Tab key
| (possibly more than once). Most programming environments will provide a list of
| variables that you've created that begin with 'my'. This is called auto-completion
| and can be quite handy when you have many variables in your workspace. Give it a
| try. (If auto-completion doesn't work for you, just type my_div and press Enter.)

> my_sqrt
[1] 0.3162278 2.8284271 1.4628739

| You're close...I can feel it! Try it again. Or, type info() for more options.

| If your programming environment doesn't support auto-completion, just type my_div
| and hit Enter to move on.

> my_div
[1] 3.478505 3.181981 2.146460

| All that practice is paying off!
