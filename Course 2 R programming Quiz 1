4) If I execute the expression x <- 4L in R, what is the class of the object `x' as determined by the `class()' function?

    integer (RIGHT) - The numeric class is the "lowest common denominator" here and so all elements will be coerced into that class.

7) A key property of vectors in R is that

    a vector cannot have have attributes like dimensions
    the length of a vector must be less than 32,768
    elements of a vector can only be character or numeric
    elements of a vector all must be of the same class (RIGHT)
    elements of a vector can be of different classes

    a numeric vector with elements 3, 2, 3, 4.
    a numeric vector with elements 3, 2, 3, 6.

10) Suppose I have a vector x <- c(3, 5, 1, 10, 12, 6) and I want to set all elements of this vector that are less than 6 to be equal to zero. What R code achieves this? Select all that apply.

    x[x >= 6] <- 0
    x[x <= 5] <- 0  (RIGHT)
    x[x > 0] <- 6 
    x[x != 6] <- 0
    x[x > 6] <- 0
